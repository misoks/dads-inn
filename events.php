    <h2>The 23rd Annual Dads Inn Daddy-Daughter Valentine's Day Dance</h2>
    <span class="event__date">February 14th, 7 - 10pm</span>
    <p>Invite your estranged daughter to our annual dance to celebrate the unique 
        relationship between father and daughter! As usual, the dance will be hosted by
        our very own former professional radio DJ Mike Kowalcek. He promises he'll be 
        spinning "all of the late seventies' greatest daddy-daughter classics."</p>
    <p>Daughter attendance has been disappointing in past
        years, but event coordinator John Walters says he's been making repeated phone
        calls to his daughters Helena and Jamie and is sure that they would agree to 
        come if their mother would just put them on the phone and let him explain 
        what happened in Orlando.</p>
    <p>Punch and refreshments will be served in the Ballroom/Conference Center.</p>
